== Favorite books
These are my favorite academic books from different fields.  They're all succint, logical, and clear, without indulging in arcane mathematical details.
- /Microeconomic Theory/, David Luenberger.
- /Thermodynamics and an Introduction to Thermostatistics/, Herbert B. Callen.
- /Basic Circuit Theory/, Charles A. Desoer and Ernest S. Kuh.
- /Convex Optimization/, Stephen Boyd.
